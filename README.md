This is the classic snake game, made using Python and the Tkinter library. The user controls a snake, which grows by eating food. If the head of the snake hits the wall or itself,
the game finishes. The score increases as the snake grows. This application is made using an OOP approach, which both simplifies the code and makes it easier to make future
changes to the code.
